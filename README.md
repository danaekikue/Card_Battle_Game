# Card Battle Game
A project for Web and Mobile informtion Systems class of Digital Systema, department of Piraeus University.  You chose randomly 5 different cards and you start the game battle against the pc bot. Possible actions that can be taken are either to defend, attack or reset the game. Card characters are characters from the Final Fantasy franchise.

This is a static HTML page where you only need to download or clone the repo and then try the game by opening the index.html file in your preferred browser. It has been tested with chrome.

I am planning on recreating this project, using and experimenting with Vue.js.
